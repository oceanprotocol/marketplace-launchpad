## Aquarius - Ocean Metadata Storage

### What is Aquarius?

Aquarius is an off-chain, multi-chain cache for metadata that is published on chain, connected to an Elasticsearch database. Aquarius continually monitors the chains for MetadataCreated and MetadataUpdated events, processes these events and adds them to the database. The Aquarius API offers a convenient way to access the medatata without scanning the chain yourself.

Aquarius is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) toolset. ðŸŒŠ

### What it does:

- Stores metadata for Ocean Protocol Assets
- Decentralized, reads metadata events from blockchain and caches them
- All aquarius instances will contain the same data -> load balancing, fail over

### Technology used:

Python Flask HTTP server + Elastic Search
