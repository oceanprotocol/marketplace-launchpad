# ü§ù User flows



Ocean Market provides a convenient and familiar interface for you to publish and sell your data. If you haven‚Äôt seen it before, now is a good time to have a look at the site. You‚Äôll find it looks a lot like any other data marketplace ‚Äî running the blockchain doesn‚Äôt compromise usability.

What you decide to sell via Ocean is entirely up to you. The dataset can comprise images, location information, audio, video, sales data, or combinations. There is no exhaustive list of what type of data can be published; you can be as creative as you want. Just make sure that the data you‚Äôre selling is legal and not in breach of copyright or other regulations, our policies can be found here.

There are only a few unfamiliar things you need to get used to when selling data over the blockchain:
- Every interaction with the blockchain costs money. There is no centralized company controlling the system that will pay for computation and server costs, so the user must pay. This is called the gas fee ‚Äî it‚Äôs basically like putting gas into your car to make it run.
- You need to have a wallet to store the cryptocurrency that you will be paying for these gas fees. This can easily be set up as a browser extension.
- Each time you interact with the blockchain, you will be asked to ‚Äúsign‚Äù a transaction. This is the process where you pay the gas fees and verify the origin of the transaction. It is equivalent to being asked to enter your pin when you pay with a credit card.

## How does publishing work in Ocean Protocol? 

If you‚Äôre familiar with the blockchain space, you may be wondering which blockchain Ocean Protocol uses. It was originally deployed on Ethereum but we have since deployed to four other chains, and there will be more to come in the future.

It is important to note that the gas cost associated with signing transactions on different blockchains varies significantly. For the purpose of this guide, we will be focusing on how to publish datasets on the Ethereum blockchain, as it is the most ubiquitous. However ‚Äî it is also the most expensive. If you would like to explore a cheaper option, we recommend reading our blog post on using Polygon. We also have instructions in our documentation on how to transfer funds from Ethereum to Polygon (via a bridge).

<Process>

Setup Your Wallet

Add Ether cryptocurrency to your wallet

Publish your data asset on Ocean Market

Connect your account

Enter your dataset information into the publish form

Sign the transactions & publish your dataset 

Decide on pricing type

Create pricing for a data set

</Process>

### Fixed rate exchange

Fixed pricing is fairly self-explanatory ‚Äî you set the price and that‚Äôs what customers pay to access your data. You can change the price at any time and customers will always have to pay the amount that you set.

### Dynamic Pricing 

Dynamic pricing is a little more complicated as the price is determined by an automated version of an order book. This concept is called an Automated Market Marker (AMM). Under the hood, Ocean uses the Balancer AMM.

If you would like to create dynamic pricing you will need to purchase Ocean tokens so that you can provide liquidity to the AMM pool. The price that the customer pays is set by the ratio of Ocean tokens to datatokens within the pool. As more people purchase the datatokens, the ratio changes and the price increases. If you remove Ocean tokens from the pool the ratio changes in the other direction and the datatoken price goes down.

Anyone can add liquidity to the pool you have created ‚Äî they are known as liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees when the datatoken is purchased.


## How does data consumption work in Ocean Protocol?

- Go to Ocean Marketplace https://market.oceanprotocol.com/
- Search for the data asset. The Ocean Marketplace provides features to search the Data/Algorithms by text, and users can also sort the result by published date.
