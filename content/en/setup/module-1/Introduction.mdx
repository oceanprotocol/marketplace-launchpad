# Introduction

Have you ever wondered how to make money over the blockchain? If you have datasets to sell, you will be amazed at how simple the process is. The blockchain often sounds like a complex and abstract concept that requires a lot of technical knowledge. In reality, interacting and selling datasets over the blockchain is an incredibly straightforward process that only has a couple of unfamiliar steps.

We understand that many companies don’t feel comfortable sharing or selling data. This is because sharing data is perceived to be a risk — the risk of either losing your competitive advantage or violating strict data privacy regulations. This is why we have been driven to build you the tools so that sharing data means gaining control and preserving privacy.

## What problem does Ocean Solve?

From the very beginning, Ocean has strived to put you in control of your data. We are on a mission to break the black-box data selling model of Facebook and others. We achieve this through the core concepts of access control, orchestration, and decentralization. With access control and orchestration, any data or AI service can be shared under the conditions set by the owner of data. There is no central intermediary, which ensures no one can interfere with the transaction and both the publisher and user have transparency.

Ocean Protocol gives you complete control of your data by removing any third parties from the process, selling data over the blockchain is completely decentralized. As we will demonstrate below, Ocean also gives you a super easy-to-use marketplace for selling your data. This reduces the barriers to entry and brings you customers for your data assets.

## How does Ocean enable data sharing while maintaining privacy?

While Ocean Market is a great place for selling data, we also understand that some data is too sensitive to be shared — potentially due to GDPR or other reasons. For these types of datasets, we offer a unique service called compute-to-data. This enables you to monetize the dataset that sits behind a firewall without ever revealing the raw data to the consumer. Researchers and data scientists pay to run their algorithms on the data set, and the computation is performed behind a firewall; all they receive is the results generated by the algorithm.

## Why should you use Ocean Protocol / what makes it different?

By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain, Ocean Protocol offers you so much more control than a typical data market. The gatekeeper to accessing your data is a smart contract, which is an immutable piece of code running on the blockchain that no one can change. You can have confidence that the terms and conditions to access your dataset can never be altered by an intermediary.
