# Using Ocean Market

## A Data Marketplaces with Blockchain Superpowers

Ocean Market is a decentralized exchange (DEX), tuned for data.

Use Ocean Market to publish data, stake on data (curate), and buy data. You can also earn by selling, staking, or running your own fork of Ocean Market.

Data published on Ocean has automatic price discovery and is published as interoperable ERC20 datatokens.

Compute-to-data enables private data to be monetized in a privacy preserving manner.

Ocean-powered data markets combine the building blocks of data NFTs, ERC20 datatokens, automated market maker (AMM) pools, and Compute-to-Data for earning opportunities, automated price discovery, interoperability, privacy, and more.

## Publishing Datasets

Ocean Market provides a convenient interface for individuals and organizations to publish their data. Datasets can be images, location information, audio, video, sales data, or combinations of all! There is no exhaustive list of what type of data can be published on the Market.

Upon publishing a dataset, it becomes a data asset with its own data NFT and associated ERC20 datatokens which give access to the data asset.

The publisher can set a fixed price, or let price be auto-discovered. Ocean Market supports the latter with an Automated Market Maker (AMM) powered by Balancer, deployed in a gas-efficient manner.

Anyone can stake OCEAN in a datatoken AMM pool. Stakers are liquidity providers . Stakers are also curators, as the amount of stake is a proxy to dataset quality.

## Ocean-Powered Marketplaces Offer Exciting New Opportunities

### Earn

Earn by staking, selling data, or building & launching your own marketplace. Stakers earn a cut of the transaction fee proportional to their stake. Sellers get the bulk of sales revenue when a dataset is sold. Ocean-powered marketplace operators can take a % of every dataset sold in the marketplace.

### Automated price discovery

A given data asset's AMM pool holds both OCEAN and the datatoken as liquidity. Price is based on the ratio of OCEAN tokens versus datatokens in the pool. If datatokens are sold, then more OCEAN enters and datatokens leave, so datatoken price goes up. If more datatokens enter or OCEAN leaves, then datatoken price goes down.

### Privacy-preserving

Ocean Compute-to-Data allows private data to be bought & sold while preserving control and privacy of the data.

### Interoperability

Ocean-powered markets publish data NFTS and enable selling, trading and staking ERC20 datatokens. Therefore you can publish a datatoken in Ocean Market, store it in Metamask, transfer it to a DAO, and perform other DeFi operations.

### Universal Login

Universal login via your Web3 wallet. No further password or account management needed.
