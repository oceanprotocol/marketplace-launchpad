# Setting up a Wallet

## What is a wallet?

A wallet usually means “a thing that stores private keys (and maybe signs transactions)” - this is explained further below. Examples include MetaMask, Trezor, and Ledger wallets.

A wallet can sometimes mean (web3) software for interacting with a thing that stores private keys. Examples include MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, and MyCrypto.

Note how MetaMask is in both lists!

## Wallet Related Terminology

When you set up a new wallet, it might generate a seed phrase for you. **Store that seed phrase somewhere secure and non-digital (e.g. on paper in a safe).** It’s extremely secret and sensitive. Anyone with your wallet’s seed phrase could spend all the Ether and Ocean Tokens in all the accounts in your wallet.

Once your wallet is set up, it will have one or more accounts.

Each account has several balances, e.g. an Ether balance, an Ocean Token balance, and maybe other balances. All balances start at zero.

An account’s Ether balance might be 7.1 ETH in the Ethereum Mainnet, 2.39 ETH in Ropsten testnet. You can move ETH from one network to another only with a specially setup exchange or bridge. Also, you can’t transfer tokens from networks holding value such as Ethereum mainnet to networks not holding value, i.e. testnets like Ropsten. The same is true of OCEAN token balances.

Each account has one private key and one address. The address can be calculated from the private key. You must keep the private key secret because it’s what’s needed to spend/transfer ETH and OCEAN (or to sign transactions of any kind). You can share the address with others. In fact, if you want someone to send some ETH or OCEAN to an account, you give them the account’s address.

Note that unlike traditional pocket wallets, crypto wallets don’t actually store ETH or OCEAN. They store private keys.

## Our Recommendations

- Easiest: Use MetaMask browser plug-in.
- Still easy, but more secure: Get a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet, and use MetaMask to interact with it.
- The OCEAN Token page at oceanprotocol.com lists some other possible wallets.

## Set Up MetaMask Wallet

Follow these steps to set up MetaMask for Chrome:

<Process>
Go to the Chrome Web Store for extensions and search for MetaMask.

Install MetaMask. The wallet provides a friendly user interface that will help you through each step. MetaMask gives you two options: importing an existing wallet or creating a new one. Choose to Create a Wallet:

Create a wallet - In the next step create a new password for your wallet. Read through and accept the terms and conditions. After that, MetaMask will generate Secret Backup Phrase for you. Write it down and store it in a safe place.

Secret Backup Phrase - Continue forward. On the next page, MetaMask will ask you to confirm the backup phrase. Select the words in the correct sequence:

Confirm secret backup phrase - Voila! Your account is now created. You can access MetaMask via the browser extension in the top right corner of your browser.

You can now manage Ether and Ocean Tokens with your wallet. You can copy your account address to the clipboard from the options. When you want someone to send Ether or Ocean Tokens to you, you will have to give them that address. It’s not a secret.

</Process>

### Set Up Custom Network

Sometimes it is required to use custom or external networks in MetaMask. We can add a new one through MetaMask’s Settings.

Open the Settings menu and find the Networks option. When you open it, you’ll be able to see all available networks your MetaMask wallet currently use. Click the Add Network button.

Add custom/external network

There are a few empty inputs we need to fill:

- Network Name: this is the name that MetaMask is going to use to differentiate your network from the rest.
- New RPC URL: to operate with a network we need an endpoint (RPC). This can be a public or private URL.
- Chain Id: each chain has an Id
- Currency Symbol: it’s the currency symbol MetaMask uses for your network
- Block Explorer URL: MetaMask uses this to provide a direct link to the network block explorer when a new transaction happens
