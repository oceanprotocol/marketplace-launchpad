# üêã Orientation

## Learn how to create your own blockchain data marketplace

The Marketplace Launchpad is a step-by-step guide on how to setup and launch your own data marketplace, with blockchain superpowers! This orientation section will get you accustomed with Ocean Market and using web3 applications. If you are already familiar with Ocean Protocol and comfortable using Ocean Market, you can skip ahead to the [Quickstart section](../module-2).

One of Ocean Protocol‚Äôs most powerful tools is its decentralized data marketplace that was specifically designed to enable data owners to monetize their data while preserving privacy and control and providing data buyers direct access to data that was previously unavailable.

Since Ocean Protocol is open source anyone can fork Ocean Market to launch their own Ocean-powered marketplace and quickly begin operating their very own data driven business.

The Marketplace Launchpad is designed to help businesses quickly and easily set up a whitelabel Ocean-powered data marketplace for monetizing data and digital business assets.

Clients can start from a hands-on quick start support module (ideal for experienced data sellers) or jump to our enterprise section for new or large data sellers that need qualified support to prepare, launch, scale and maintain their data monetization operations.
