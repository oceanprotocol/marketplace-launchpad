# ü§ù Mission Statement

## Our Mission

Society is becoming increasingly reliant on data, especially with the advent of AI. However, a small handful of organizations with both massive data assets and AI capabilities attained worrying levels of control which is a danger to a free and open society.

<b>
  We aim to unlock data, for more equitable outcomes for users of data, using a
  thoughtful application of both technology and governance.
</b>
<br />
<br />

Our team and community is committed to kick-starting a New Data Economy that reaches every single person, company and device, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our world.

Ocean Protocol is governed by a Singapore based non-profit foundation, whose mandate is to ensure open access to the protocol and platform, provide data governance, encourage the network ecosystem growth, and take measures to ensure that the platform becomes ever more decentralized with time.
