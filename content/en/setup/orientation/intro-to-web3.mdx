# Introduction to Web3

Since Web3 emerged in 2014 as a term to describe the new types of protocols that enable decentralized consensus, it has now come to describe an entire ecosystem of public blockchains, applications, and even design philosophies. As with other great esoteric ideas, the question “What is Web3?” elicits a torrent of answers that are as varied as the people articulating them. For some, new jargon can be alienating. This section is aimed to help you become more familiar with key ideas related to Web3 and provide some examples to help illustrate these ideas in practice.

- Web3 is the new trendy name for the decentralized web.
- Web3 is a money layer for the internet.
- Web3 is an identity layer for the internet.

## WEB2 VS WEB3

Web2 refers to the version of the internet most of us know today. An internet dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data. Web3, in the context of Ethereum, refers to decentralized applications (dapps) that run on the blockchain. Dapps are applications that allow anyone to participate without monetising their personal data.

## WEB3 BENEFITS

Many Web3 developers have chosen to build dapps on Ethereum because of its inherent decentralization:

- Anyone who is on the network has permission to use the service – or in other words, permission isn't required.
- No one can block you or deny you access to the service.
- Payments are built in via the native token - in the case of Ethereum the native token is ether (ETH).
- Ethereum is Turing complete, meaning you can pretty much program anything.

### PRACTICAL COMPARISONS

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Twitter can censor any account or tweet                                    | Web3 tweets would be uncensorable because control is decentralized                                             |
| Payment service may decide to not allow payments for certain types of work | Web3 payment apps require no personal data and can't prevent payments                                          |
| Servers for gig-economy apps could go down and affect worker income        | Web3 servers can't go down – they use Ethereum, a decentralized network of 1000s of computers as their backend |

This doesn't mean that all services need to be turned into a dapp. These examples are illustrative of the main differences between web2 and web3 services.

## WEB3 LIMITATIONS

### Web3 has some limitations right now:

- **Scalability** – transactions are slower on web3 because they're decentralized. Changes to state, like a payment, need to be processed by a miner and propagated throughout the network.
- **UX** – interacting with web3 applications can require extra steps, software, and education. This can be a hurdle to adoption.
- **Accessibility** – the lack of integration in modern web browsers makes web3 less accessible to most users.
- **Cost** – most successful dapps put very small portions of their code on the blockchain as it's expensive.
