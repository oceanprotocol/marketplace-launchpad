# Using Ocean Market

## A Data Marketplaces with Blockchain Superpowers

Use Ocean Market to publish data, stake on data (curate), and buy data. Earn by selling, staking, or running your own fork of Ocean Market. Data has automatic price discovery. Data is published as interoperable ERC20 datatokens. Compute-to-data enables private data to be bought & sold. It's a decentralized exchange (DEX), tuned for data.

Ocean-powered data markets combine the building blocks of ERC20 datatokens, OCEAN-datatoken AMM pools, and Compute-to-Data for earning opportunities, automated price discovery, interoperability, privacy, and more.

## Publishing Datasets

Publishing a dataset amounts to an Initial Data Offering (IDO). It can be data that the user has rights to, or open data with value-added.

Upon publishing a dataset, it becomes a data asset with its own ERC20 datatoken.

The publisher can set a fixed price, or let price be auto-discovered. Ocean Market supports the latter with an Automated Market Maker (AMM) powered by Balancer, deployed in a gas-efficient manner.

Anyone can stake OCEAN in a datatoken AMM pool. Stakers are liquidity providers [ref]. Stakers are also curators, as the amount of stake is a proxy to dataset quality.

## Ocean Market Offers So Much More

### Earn
Earn by staking, selling data, or building & launching your own marketplace. Stakers earn a cut of the transaction fee proportional to their stake. Sellers get the bulk of sales revenue when a dataset is sold. Running a marketplace takes a % of every dataset sold in the marketplace. Here are details.

### Automated price discovery
A given data asset's AMM pool holds both OCEAN and the datatoken as liquidity. Price is based on the ratio of OCEAN tokens versus datatokens in the pool. If datatokens are sold, then more OCEAN enters and datatokens leave, so datatoken price goes up. If more datatokens enter or OCEAN leaves, then datatoken price goes down.

### Privacy-preserving
Ocean Compute-to-Data allows private data to be bought & sold while preserving control and privacy of the data.

### Interoperability
Ocean-powered markets publish, buy, sell, and consume datatokens, which are ERC20. Therefore you can publish a datatoken in Ocean Market, store it in Metamask, transfer it to a DAO, and perform other DeFi operations.

### Universal Login
Universal login via your Web3 wallet. No further password or account management needed.
