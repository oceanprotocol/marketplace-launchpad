# Ocean Protocol Core Concepts

One of Ocean Protocol’s most powerful tools is its decentralized data marketplace that was specifically designed to enable data owners to monetize their data while preserving privacy and control and providing data buyers direct access to data that was previously unavailable. 

Since Ocean Protocol is open source anyone can fork Ocean Market to launch their own Ocean-powered marketplace and quickly begin operating their very own data driven business.    

Interested in launching your own white label data marketplace powered by Ocean? 
Ocean has created three convenient Marketplace Launchpad packages designed to help businesses quickly and easily set up a whitelabel Ocean-powered data marketplace for monetizing data and digital business assets. 

Clients can select from a hands-on quick start support package (ideal for experienced data sellers) or from premium and full service packages for new or large data sellers that need qualified support to prepare, launch, scale and maintain their data monetization operations.

Get started today!

## What is a Data NFT?

NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenise things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. These things are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties.

Fungible items, on the other hand, can be exchanged because their value defines them rather than their unique properties. For example, ETH or dollars are fungible because 1 ETH / $1 USD is exchangeable for another 1 ETH / $1 USD.

A way to represent anything unique as an Ethereum-based asset.

NFTs are giving more power to content creators than ever before.

## What is a datatoken?

Every asset (dataset, algorithm) in the Ocean Network has an associated datatoken, which is an ERC20 token.

A datatoken acts as an access token: If you have 1.0 datatokens, you can access the data by sending it to the Provider

In order to create pricing schemas, you have to sell the datatokens to users using either a Fixed Rate Exchange (FRE) schema, either creating an AMM Pool, thus having price discovery.


## What is a DID and a DDO?

Every asset (dataset, algorithm) in Ocean has an associated Decentralized Identifier (DID) and DID Descriptor Object (DDO). Because assets without proper descriptive metadata have poor visibility and discoverability.

Ocean Protocol has its own identifier in W3C schema   (did:op:)

A DDO document is composed of standard DDO attributes:
- did
- created
- updated
- publicKey
- authentication
- proof
- Services (See below)

### DDO Services

Each type of asset (dataset, algorithm, etc, ..) typically will have associated different kind of services. This are the types of services that are commonly added to all the assets:
- metadata - describing the asset
- access - describe conditions to be fulfilled in order to consume this data
- compute -  describe conditions to be fulfilled in order to run compute on top of the data


## What are the different components of the Ocean architecture? 

<Process>
Level 1 - Network level (Smart Contracts)

Level 2 - Component level (Backend components and Libraries)

Level 3 - Decentralised applications (DApps) - Ocean Market etc.
</Process>


## What networks does Ocean Protocol run on? 

### Production networks:
<Process>
