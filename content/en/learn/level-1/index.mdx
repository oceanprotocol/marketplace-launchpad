#  🐋 Introduction to Ocean Marketplace Launchpad

One of Ocean Protocol’s most powerful tools is its decentralized data marketplace that was specifically designed to enable data owners to monetize their data while preserving privacy and control and providing data buyers direct access to data that was previously unavailable. 

Since Ocean Protocol is open source anyone can fork Ocean Market to launch their own Ocean-powered marketplace and quickly begin operating their very own data driven business.    

Interested in launching your own white label data marketplace powered by Ocean? 
Ocean has created three convenient Marketplace Launchpad packages designed to help businesses quickly and easily set up a whitelabel Ocean-powered data marketplace for monetizing data and digital business assets. 

Clients can select from a hands-on quick start support package (ideal for experienced data sellers) or from premium and full service packages for new or large data sellers that need qualified support to prepare, launch, scale and maintain their data monetization operations.
