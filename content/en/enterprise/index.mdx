## How is an Ocean powered data marketplace different from other marketplaces?

Ocean powered data marketplaces **give users complete control of their data.** Ocean Protocol technology is built on smart contracts, which are decentralized computer scripts with no intermediary that are triggered by the users.

An Ocean-powered data marketplace exposes the functionality of the smart contracts in a **browser-friendly interface** so that data providers and consumers can discover one another and transact in a **peer-to-peer** manner with the minimal amount of intermediary involvement.

With respect to data compliance, Ocean does not store data; instead **users have the choice to store their data on their own servers, cloud or decentralized storage**. Users need only to provide a URL to the dataset, which is then encrypted as a means to protect the access to the dataset.

Ocean also offers powerful **fine-grained permissions** that enable users to easily set up role-based access control and ‚Äúallow and deny‚Äù lists that restrict access from certain individuals or limit access to particular organizations.

Furthermore, with **off-the-shelf privacy preserving features such as Compute-to-Data (C2D)**, data and algorithms can be ingested into secure Docker containers so that escapes are avoided, protecting both the data and algorithms.

Ocean also leverages **NFT technology** to enable the transfer of base IP allowing for multiple revenue streams on the base IP, the accumulation of value to the base IP before monetization, and leveraging the recent growth of tooling in the broader NFT ecosystem. This further solidifies the establishment of **data as a new asset class**.

Last but not least, Ocean powered marketplace operators stand to benefit from **attractive earnings** linked to profit participation from each individual sale (when data is consumed) as well as profit participation from "swaps" on individual datasets (when data is staked), the latter of which is a high volume activity.
