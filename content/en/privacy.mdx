# Privacy Policy

If you have Do Not Track activated or do not interact with our cookie banner, we don’t collect any information at all about your visit on our site. If you accept cookies, we make sure to only collect the bare minimum of information needed, as described in this Privacy Policy.


## Introduction

Our Privacy Policy sets out how your personal information is collected and used while you use our site. We believe your personal information belongs to you, so we are very open about how we use it.

If you have questions about the Privacy Policy, want to know what data we store about you, or if you want to withdraw your consent to any data processing, let us know by emailing [gdpr@oceanprotocol.com](mailto:gdpr@oceanprotocol.com).

## Our Policies

We collect and use information in accordance with the GDPR, or with your specific and express consent. We may process your data outside of the EU but regardless of where we process it, we will always conform to EU level data privacy and data protection standards.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 without consent from a parent or guardian. If we learn a child has provided personal information, we may delete it.

## What Information We Collect and How We Use It

When you visit our site, we don’t log any information about your visit. We also don’t load any 3rd party scripts tracking your individual behavior across multiple channels, like A/B testing tools, social network or sharing buttons, and so on.

We simply don’t measure your engagement with our brand based on tracking you, because we believe this is always in violation of your privacy, and ultimately meaningless.

### Web Services

The site communicates against those services where some data collection, like time of request and the user's IP address might be collected:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), subject to their [Terms](https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com), subject to their [Terms](https://vercel.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/privacy)

Additionally, if you are submitting one of our web forms, your entered data is stored and processed with:

- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), subject to their [Terms](https://sendgrid.com/policies/tos/) and [Privacy Policy](https://sendgrid.com/policies/privacy/)
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), subject to their [Terms](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en) and [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)

### Cookies

A cookie is a small file that stores Internet settings. Almost every website uses cookie technology. It is downloaded by your web browser on the first visit to a website. The next time this website is opened with the same user device, the cookie and the information stored in it is either sent back to the website that created it (first-party cookie) or sent to another website it belongs to (third-party cookie). This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and in some cases to vary the displayed content.

When you first arrive on our site, a cookie banner will be shown. By accepting the cookies you help us to provide better content in the future. The only downside for rejecting cookies on your side is that you will not be able to see some content loaded from external sources,which at the moment is only Twitter content.

On our site, only Google Analytics and Twitter set cookies. We have to set a cookie of our own though, for remembering your acceptance or rejection of our cookie banner. This cookie will stay in your browser for 13 months, unless you delete it manually. This is so we can detect your acceptance or rejection on your next visit, and adapt the site accordingly.

If you have Do Not Track activated in your browser, or if you rejected our cookie banner, we won’t let Google set any cookies in your browser.

You also have the option of disabling cookies in your browser setting, and deleting cookies from your computer’s hard disk at any time.

If you want to change your cookie consent click the _Cookie Settings_ link in the bottom of the page.

In general, you can block cookies by using your browser’s settings, or by installing a browser add-on such as [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) or [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

### Google Analytics

The site uses Google Analytics, which provides us with anonymized information about our users (such as anonymized IP address, browser version, and so on) and how they use the site. We use this information to make the site better.

The collected IP addresses are truncated before being sent to Google, making them anonymized. Google Analytics also sets cookies.

If you hit _Reject_ on the cookie banner, all previously set Google cookies will be deleted, and the rejection is stored in a cookie `CookieConsent` with value of `false`.
