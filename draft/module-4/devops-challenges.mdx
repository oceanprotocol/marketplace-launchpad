## How to keep billing cost low when hosting and running your market

Managing costs is a challenge for organizations using public cloud services but also an opportunity to drive efficient consumption of IT. This research provides I&O technical professionals with a framework to manage costs of cloud-integrated IaaS and PaaS providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.

- Focusing on efficient use of cloud services brings immediate and tangible financial benefits. Unfortunately, most organizations are unprepared to profit from this savings opportunity and they’re likely to overspend.

- Cloud cost management is not just an operational concern. To be successful, it requires a tight collaboration among the disciplines of governance, architecture, operations, product management, finance and application development.

- Correlating cloud costs to business KPIs allows organizations to manage spending in respect to its return on investment (ROI). It also enables organizations to assess the business impact of cost growth and optimization. Driving costs down as a principle must not be done at the expense of being unable to fully support the business goals.

- Major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure offer native tools to manage costs, albeit with basic functionality. Third-party tools continue to advance their cost management functionality with a multicloud approach.

### Recommendations

Technical professionals in charge of IT operations and cloud management should:

- Make cloud consumers accountable for what they spend. Provide them with the resources to create forecasts, monitor costs and pursue optimization opportunities.

- Build cost-tracking foundations using both provider-native hierarchies and tags. Use them to organize resources around principles such as applications, departments or cost centers.

- Drive cost optimization by monitoring utilization and capacity metrics. Schedule and rightsize allocation-based services. Leverage programmatic discounts. Modernize applications to make use of provider managed services when these are more cost-effective.

- Deploy the cloud provider’s native tools to manage spending. Augment them with third-party tools if multicloud consistency, provider independence or a more integrated approach is needed.

## Recommended security and identity management practises.

Identity and access management (IAM) best practices seek to clearly define, and oversee the access privileges granted to network users, and ensure that access is only granted to those within the organization.

Think of identity and access management best practices and tools as gatekeepers, tasked to either allow or deny entry, depending on who or what is trying to enter the “premises”, as well as closely monitor all visitors’ movements within the designated “area”.

Identity and access management best practices are comprised of the following intrinsic elements:

- Identification of individual users within a given system or network
- Identification of specific user roles, and the assignment of such to eligible individuals
- Adding, updating, or removing individuals and their corresponding roles within a given system or network
- Establishment and assignment levels of access for an individual user or a group of individuals
- Security of the overall system or network, and all information within it

## How to troubleshoot and analyse issues when something goes wrong

DevOps focuses on eliminating or at least reducing latency in software development. This means developers are able to shorten time to market by automating many of the bottlenecks common with legacy applications.28 Oct 2020

When you have an issue try to:

- Divide the problem space.
- Practice good communication when collaborating, including conference calls, direct conversation, email, and real-time chat rooms.
- Document your problems and solutions.
- Understand how the systems work.
- Favor fast solutions.
- Know what has been changed.

## Common errors to avoid

Mauris hendrerit, eros eu tempor iaculis, mauris massa egestas arcu, et aliquet orci tellus et ligula. Nunc urna est, mattis in ante id, porttitor dictum massa. Phasellus placerat a orci sed convallis. Integer at dolor at magna rutrum aliquam. Aliquam vehicula accumsan posuere. Etiam quis aliquet nisl. Integer ultricies libero et nisi tincidunt, id facilisis neque finibus. Fusce ac nisi lacus.
